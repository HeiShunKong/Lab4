    Hi, I am Hei Shun Kong you can call me Hazen. I was borned in Hong Kong and
    immigrated to Vancouver when I was 13 years old. For my hobbies, I really like 
    playing video games, skiing, and hanging out with friends. Recently, I watched a
    movie called "Don't Look up". It is about a meteorite that will crash on earth but 
    no one belives it no matter what the sceintists said. Finally, I hope covid will be
    over soon.
